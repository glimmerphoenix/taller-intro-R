# Introducci√≥n {.unnumbered}

This book describes how to use Quarto, a software for scientific
document production, to create publications in the areas of Ecology
and Plant Research.

Quarto has become a powerful and verstaile addition in the research
toolkit, providing complete support to implement **reproducible** research
workflows. The quest for open access research, including not only the final
product (manuscripts) but also ancillary research materials (source code,
datasets, figures, pipelines, setup files, etc.) is a prominent concern
among scholars and practitioners in many fields. Prestigious publicatons
require authors to submit these materials with manuscript drafts to let 
other colleagues reproduce and validate the results, replicate
studies in new cohorts or improve the intepretability of results.

Quarto let us combine formatted text and executable source code into
a single document. That source code *chunks* can be written in different programming
langugaes such as R, Python, Julia or Observable. As we will see, it is 
even possible to combine different programming languages in the same document 
or collection of documents, providing even more versatility to the mix.

This is a **practical guide**, presenting hands-on examples and commands to 
produce your own Quarto documents in short time. In addition,
along this way key concepts and best practices are also presented to steer
new Quarto apprentices in the right direction.
