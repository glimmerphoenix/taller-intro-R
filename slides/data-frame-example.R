# Joining data frames

  ## Joining data frames
  
#- `left_join()`: all rows from x
#- `right_join()`: all rows from y
#- `full_join()`: all rows from both x and y
#- `semi_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x
#- `inner_join()`: all rows from x where there are matching values in y, return 
#all combination of multiple matches in the case of multiple matches
#- `anti_join()`: return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, never duplicate rows of x
#- ...

## Setup
y1 <- tibble(
    id = c(1, 2, 3),
    value_x = c("x1", "x2", "x3")
  )
y1

y2 <- tibble(
    id = c(1, 2, 4),
    value_y = c("y1", "y2", "y4")
  )
y2

  
## `left_join()`
  
left_join(x, y)


## `left_join()`
  
professions %>%
  left_join(dates) #<<



## `right_join()`
  
right_join(x, y)

professions %>%
  right_join(dates) #<<

## `full_join()`
full_join(x, y)
dates %>%
  full_join(works) #<<


## `inner_join()`
  
inner_join(x, y)

## `inner_join()`
  
dates %>%
  inner_join(works) #<<

## `semi_join()`
semi_join(x, y)

dates %>%
  semi_join(works) #<<


## `anti_join()`

## Putting it altogether

## Student records
  
#  - Have:
#  - Enrolment: official university enrolment records
#- Survey: Student provided info missing students who never filled it out and including students who filled it out but dropped the class
#- Want: Survey info for all enrolled in class
